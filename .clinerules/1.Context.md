# Retro Cafe SPA - Project Context

## Project Overview

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) for "Retro Cafe", a coffee shop with a distinctive retro 8-bit aesthetic. The application is built using React with React Router DOM for client-side routing.

## Core Design Principles

### Visual Identity

- **Primary Theme**: Retro 8-bit aesthetic with pixel art elements
- **Design Balance**: Combines nostalgic gaming aesthetics with modern, elegant UI/UX
- **User Experience**: Clear, intuitive, and user-friendly interface
- **Consistency**: Maintain visual and functional consistency across all pages

### Technical Architecture

- **Framework**: React with functional components and hooks
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for seamless navigation without page reloads
- **Styling Approach**: CSS/Bootstrap with custom retro-themed overrides
- **State Management**: Local state with React hooks (useState, useContext as needed)
- **Build Tool**: Create React App or modern build setup

## Application Structure

### Navigation Sections

The application consists of 5 main sections:

1. **HOME** - Landing page with brand introduction
2. **ABOUT** - Story, values, and team information
3. **MENU** - Coffee and food offerings
4. **SHOP** - Merchandise and coffee products
5. **REWARDS** - Loyalty program information

### Routing Requirements

- Implement dynamic routing with React Router DOM
- Support nested routes where appropriate
- Handle 404/error pages gracefully
- Enable programmatic navigation for user actions
- All sections are publicly accessible (no authentication required)

## Development Guidelines

### Component Architecture

- Create reusable UI components following React best practices
- Implement a consistent header/navigation component
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow single responsibility principle

### Styling Conventions

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for component-specific styles
- Maintain a consistent color palette inspired by retro gaming
- Implement pixel-perfect borders, buttons, and UI elements where appropriate

### Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow React naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy load components where beneficial
- Optimize images and assets
- Minimize bundle size
- Ensure smooth transitions and animations

## Retro Gaming Elements

- Pixel art graphics and icons
- 8-bit inspired typography
- Retro color schemes (think NES/SNES era)
- Subtle animations reminiscent of classic games
- Game-inspired UI elements (health bars for rewards, pixel buttons, etc.)

## Modern Web Standards

- Fully responsive across all devices
- Accessible (WCAG compliance where possible)
- SEO-friendly routing
- Fast loading times
- Cross-browser compatibility

## File Organization

```

├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── pages/         # Route-specific page components
├── assets/        # Images, fonts, and static assets
├── styles/        # Global styles and themes

```

## Key Features to Maintain

- Smooth page transitions without full page reloads
- Consistent retro theme throughout
- Intuitive navigation
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Clean, maintainable codebase

## Notes for Development

- When adding new features, ensure they align with the retro aesthetic
- Prioritize user experience over complex animations
- Keep the codebase modular and scalable
- Test navigation flows thoroughly
- Consider performance implications of retro effects

This context should guide development decisions while allowing flexibility for implementation details and future enhancements.
